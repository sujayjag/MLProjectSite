# CS 7641 Project

## Project Proposal

### Introduction

Professional tennis has seen numerous historic matches, tremendous athletes, and game-changing strategies over the past decade. This project aims to dive deep into this by examining a rich dataset encompassing a plethora of tennis matches. This dataset includes comprehensive details like match outcomes, betting odds, set and game outcomes, player statistics, court type, date, etc.

### Literature Review

Kovalchik delved into the realm of tennis predictions by comparing 30 different models to predict the outcomes of men's professional tennis matches over eight seasons. This comprehensive study took into account a player's past performance, player rankings, and even surface-specific performance, identifying that surface-adjusted Elo ratings were the most accurate predictors of match outcomes (Dixon, 1997).

Though not strictly on tennis, Dixon and Coles' study on association football offers valuable insights on how betting odds can play a significant role in predicting match outcomes. They developed a model for predicting match results based on a Poisson distribution, which could be applied or adjusted for tennis given the similarities in the prediction realm (Kovalchik, 2016).

Sipko tackled the NBA but introduced methods that are transferable to tennis prediction. He utilized the betting market with ranking methods, highlighting that betting odds indeed encompass significant predictive power, a testament to the efficiency of the broader betting market. This supports the idea of integrating betting odds into tennis match predictions for higher accuracy (Sipko, 2014).

Several studies have attempted to predict tennis match outcomes or understand player performances, but with the influx of data, especially related to betting odds and in-depth player stats, thereâ€™s a new opportunity to extract meaningful insights.

### Problem Definition
This project aims to harness the power of machine learning to revolutionize the way tennis outcomes are predicted, providing an analytical edge in understanding the nuances of the game. By analyzing a rich dataset that includes player matchups, rankings, tournament specifics, and betting odds, we can uncover patterns that offer deeper insights into player performances and predict tournament trajectories with greater accuracy. This approach not only enhances the understanding of the sport but also offers valuable perspectives for fans, analysts, and betting markets. The primary objective of this project is to predict tennis game, set, and match outcomes based on a series of parameters. The vast dataset provides a great foundation to seek patterns that might not be obvious at first glance. We can use past matchups between players and seed rankings to give us crucial information on predicting the outcome of the match and the spread of the sets as well. Information like tournament location and type of surface can be factors for future games that can be analyzed as either strenghts or weaknesses for certain players. Additionally, by integrating betting odds, there's potential to evaluate the market's accuracy in forecasting match results. We could also dive into how well a player may progress throughout a tournament, and predict their results before the tournament starts.

### Methods

The project will employ a variety of machine learning algorithms, primarily starting with logistic regression and decision trees. Given the intricacy of the dataset, ensemble methods like random forests or gradient boosting might be employed later. We intend to leverage libraries such as scikit-learn. Our dataset is from Kaggle, which is a free platform that has numerous, large datasets of various topics.

### Potential Results and Discussions

Metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and the F1 score will be used to gauge the model's efficiency. We can anticipate a fairly high success rate on the prediction based on initial exploratory data analysis. However, these figures can change for the better, as we delve deeper and refine our models through testing.

### Checkpoints

Midterm Report (9 weeks into the semester):

- Initial Model Building & Testing:
- Implement the chosen machine learning models on a subset of the data.
- Run initial tests to ascertain the accuracy and efficiency of these models.
  
Final Report (End of semester):

- Model Finalization & Documentation:
- Complete any remaining testing and finalize the models.
- Thoroughly document the methods employed

### Datasets
[Dataset 1](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ehallmar/a-large-tennis-dataset-for-atp-and-itf-betting)

This dataset has many files and we are primarily focusing on using the all_matches.csv that has data regarding games dating all the way back to 1993. There is key information about each game like date, player name, rankings, and specific stats pertaining to the game like breakpoints won and serve rating. There is also data relating to specific tournaments that can be used to analyze players perfomances in certain tournaments or countries to make our model more accurate. Finally, there are data files relating to betting moneylines and spreads that can be used in consideration with out regular model results to come to different conclusions on player victories and spreads.
